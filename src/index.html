          <h2>#PROJECTS</h2><br>
  
          <p>
            â€¢ Python Web App: Developed a web application in Python's Flask framework which uses HTTP Requests library to
            obtain JSON data from a RESTful API. Jinja 2 was used to create Frontend HTML templates illustrating results. This
            Flask app was then containerized with Docker and deployed serverlessly on Google's Cloud Run platform through
            Firebase hosting with optimized CDN cache.<br><br>
            â€¢ Simulation and Control of a 6DOF Robotic Manipulator: Simulation and oine programming of a Six Degree of
            Freedom Fanuc robotic manipulator arm using RoboDK Python API to perform continuous object pick and placement
            tasks on multiple conveyor systems.<br><br>
            â€¢ Obstacle Avoiding Mobile Robot: Completed a team project with C++ in assembling a mobile autonomous robot
            which uses color detection, pattern recognition algorithms and noise filters to avoid obstacles, tracking centroid of mobile
            targets and firing plastic projectiles.<br><br>
            â€¢ Semi-Automated Race Car: Assembled a four-wheeled race car using two Arduino Nano Micro-controllers working as
            control unit. Ultrasonic sensors,Imu and Hall-eect sensors were used to develop a simple speed control and collision
            mitigation system programmed in register level code.<br><br>
